                            <h4>Prologue</h4>
                                <p>
                                    In the 80’s & 90’s – action sports had evolved from the stale scene of traditional sports thanks in part to an explosion of product innovation which in turn, created a catalyst for athlete experimentation. The chain reaction was found in everything from the new designs in skateboarding with symmetric tips; road bikes that transitioned to beefier mountain bikes and in-line skis that evolved from roller skates.
                                    <br>During this period, LINE founder Jason Levinthal is a teenager who is a consumer of all these sports – living, breathing and observing the exponential growth of the products and companies daily.
                                    <br>Unfortunately, his favorite sport, skiing, is left behind. Ingrained in their ways, ski companies at this time favor the tired designs of long, pointy, straight and stiff skis.

                            <h4>The Revolution Begins</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The Revolution Begins…
                                    <br>At age 21, Jason Levinthal enters his senior year at the University of Buffalo, NY – studying product and graphic design. Occupying the school’s woodshop for hours on end, Levinthal designs his first set of skis.
                                    <br>Using a Coleman stove to pump boiling water through copper pipes to heat and cure epoxy while applying pressure with a tire jack, Levinthal produces his first pair of twin tip skis using scavenged materials; old ski edges, wood core from lumber and plastic donated from a local snowboard company, “Function.”
                                    <br>Believing that these new skiboards could become more than a college project, Jason moves back in with his parents after graduation to start a new ski company. LINE SKIS is born in the Levinthal’s one car garage in Albany, NY.

                                <p>
                                    By the winter of 1996, LINE is a one-man ski factory that could turn out one pair of ski boards in an eight hour day. Growth is slow and Jason builds decks to support the cost of making skiboards. The first breakthrough arrives when an order is faxed from Japan for 1000 pairs! LINE moves out of the garage!

                                <p>
                                    In the Winter of 1997, the product continued to evolve but there was still no sign of demand in the U.S. In the Spring, LINE heads to the SIA and finds other companies like Salomon have entered the skiboard market with “toy-like” versions. This new type of ski becomes the talk of the show.

                                    With momentum building, LINE continues with its vision for skiing’s future and joins forces with one of the most progressive skiers of the time, Kris Ostness to develop a full length 193cm real twin tip that was years ahead of it’s time. It’s named, “The Ostness Dragon.”

                                    LINE expands its pro team which would eventually include Skogen Sprang, Mike Nick, Eric Pollard, Dash Longe and Mike Wilson, all of whom focused on pushing what was possible on skis. Additionally, LINE adds more skis to its catalog. The Mothership, Twelve Sixty, Ghetto Blaster and Dark Side are introduced providing the team with the necessary weapons of mass progression!

                                    The Chronic is released and quickly becomes a benchmark for which all other freestyle skis are compared to.

                                    Inspired by Eric Pollard’s vision of wider skis capable of everything, freeride skiing is revolutionized with the launch of the Prophet Series and quickly becomes a crowd favorite. It wins SKI Magazine Ski of the Year in 2006.

                                <p>
                                    With a swallowtail and versatile 105mm waist, LINE and Eric Pollard plant a foot at the forefront of ski development with the introduction of yet another ski that forces the industry to reimagine what exactly versatility means. Hardpack, pow — it doesn’t matter. The Sakana catapults skiing into the future with a ski that truly encourages turn variety and versatility.
