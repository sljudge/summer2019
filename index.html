                                In the 80’s & 90’s – action sports had evolved from the stale scene of traditional sports thanks in part to an explosion of product innovation which in turn, created a catalyst for athlete experimentation. The chain reaction was found in everything from the new designs in skateboarding with symmetric tips; road bikes that transitioned to beefier mountain bikes and in-line skis that evolved from roller skates.
                                <br>During this period, LINE founder Jason Levinthal is a teenager who is a consumer of all these sports – living, breathing and observing the exponential growth of the products and companies daily.
                                <br>Unfortunately, his favorite sport, skiing, is left behind. Ingrained in their ways, ski companies at this time favor the tired designs of long, pointy, straight and stiff skis.

                                The Revolution Begins…
                                <br>At age 21, Jason Levinthal enters his senior year at the University of Buffalo, NY – studying product and graphic design. Occupying the school’s woodshop for hours on end, Levinthal designs his first set of skis.
                                <br>Using a Coleman stove to pump boiling water through copper pipes to heat and cure epoxy while applying pressure with a tire jack, Levinthal produces his first pair of twin tip skis using scavenged materials; old ski edges, wood core from lumber and plastic donated from a local snowboard company, “Function.”
                                <br>Believing that these new skiboards could become more than a college project, Jason moves back in with his parents after graduation to start a new ski company. LINE SKIS is born in the Levinthal’s one car garage in Albany, NY.

                        <h4>A One Man Ski Factory</h4>
                            <p>By the winter of 1996, LINE is a one-man ski factory that could turn out one pair of ski boards in an eight hour day. Growth is slow and Jason builds decks to support the cost of making skiboards. The first breakthrough arrives when an order is faxed from Japan for 1000 pairs! LINE moves out of the garage!</p>
